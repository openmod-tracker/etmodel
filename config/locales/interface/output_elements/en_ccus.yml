      short_description: ''
      description: 'This chart shows the amount of captured CO<sub>2</sub> (supply) and the demand for CO<sub>2</sub> from utilisation, storage and export. 
        <br/><br/> <strong>Note</strong>: it is important to balance the supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> in your system. The ETM assumes 
        that excess CO<sub>2</sub> is exported when supply of CO<sub>2</sub> is higher than demand. In reality, it is desirable to
        avoid an excess supply of CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, you should improve the settings of supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        in your scenario to avoid export of excess CO<sub>2</sub>.'

      description: 'This chart shows the use of coal gases, which arise in the steel sector
        when making steel via the blast furnace production route. Various components of this production
        route, such as cokes ovens, basic oxygen furnaces and the blast furnace itself produce gases from
        coal as a side product. These gases can be re-used in the steel making process, used for power
        production or used as feedstock for other products (such as chemicals).'

      title: Net effect of demand and supply of CO<sub>2</sub> on emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart describes how the captured CO<sub>2</sub> streams affect the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        The chart contains 6 streams:
        <ol>
        <li><b>Captured:</b> this stream contains all the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in the system,
        both non-biogenic as biogenic. Its influence on the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is
        positive since when unused, the CO<sub>2</sub> of this stream could be emitted and therefore
        adding to the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        </li>
        <li><b>Imported:</b> this stream contains the imported CO<sub>2</sub> to the system. Its
        influence on the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is positive since it adds to the
        captured CO<sub>2</sub> in the system. If the CO<sub>2</sub> of this stream is unused, it
        could be emitted and therefore adding to the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emissions-import-export" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information on imported CO<sub>2</sub>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Exported:</b> this stream contains the exported CO<sub>2</sub> from the system.
        Its influence on the net total is negative since the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the system.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emissions-import-export" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information on exported CO<sub>2</sub>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Stored:</b> this stream contains all permanently stored CO<sub>2</sub> in the system.
        This stream has a negative effect since the permanently stored CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be emitted
        in the system.
        </li>
        <li><b>Indefinitely delayed:</b> this stream contains all utilised CO<sub>2</sub> in
        processes in which the captured CO<sub>2</sub> is permanently sequesterd. Therefore, this
        stream is categorised as indefinetily delayed from emission and thus has a negative effect
        on the net total.
        </li>
        <li><b>Captured biogenic share:</b> this stream contains the captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>
        (originating from CCS plants using biomass). These biogenic emissions are not counted when
        calculating the net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and are therefore subtracted from the captured
        CO<sub>2</sub> stream.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-negative-emissions" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information on negative emissions.
        </li>
        <li><b>Total:</b> this is the total net effect of CO<sub>2</sub> streams on the dashboard
        items concerning CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        </li></ol>
        <strong>Note:</strong> it is important to balance the supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> in
        your system. By default, the ETM assumes that excess CO<sub>2</sub> is exported when supply
        of CO<sub>2</sub> is higher than demand.
