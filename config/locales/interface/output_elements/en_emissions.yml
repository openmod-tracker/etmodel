      description: |
        This chart describes how the captured CO<sub>2</sub> streams affect the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        The chart contains 6 streams:
        <br/><br/>
        1. Captured 
        <br/>
        This stream contains all the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in the system, both non-biogenic as biogenic.
        Its influence on the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is positive since if unused, the CO<sub>2</sub> of this stream 
        could be emitted and therefore adding to the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
        <br/><br/>
        2. Imported
        <br/>
        This stream contains the imported CO<sub>2</sub> to the system. 
        Its influence on the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is positive since it adds to the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in the system.
        If the CO<sub>2</sub> of this stream is unused, it could be emitted and therefore adding to the net total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emissions-import-export" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>        
        for more information on imported CO<sub>2</sub>.
        <br/><br/>
        3. Exported
        <br/>
        This stream contains the exported CO<sub>2</sub> from the system.
        Its influence on the net total is negative since the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the system.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emissions-import-export" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information on exported CO<sub>2</sub>.
        <br/><br/>
        4. Stored
        <br/>
        This stream contains all permanently stored CO<sub>2</sub> in the system. 
        This stream has a negative effect since the permanently stored CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be emitted 
        in the system.
        <br/><br/>
        5. Indefinitely delayed
        <br/>
        This stream contains all utilised CO<sub>2</sub> in processes in which the captured CO<sub>2</sub> is 
        permanently sequesterd. Therefore, this stream is categorised as indefinetily delayed from emission and thus 
        has a negative effect on the net total.
        <br/><br/>
        6. Captured biogenic share
        <br/>
        This stream contains the captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> (originating from CCS pants with biomass feedstock). 
        These biogenic emissions are not counted when calculating the net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and are therefore 
        subtracted from the captured CO<sub>2</sub> stream.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-negative-emissions" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information on negative emissions.
        <br/><br/>
        7. Total
        <br/>
        This is the total net effect of positive and negative captured CO<sub>2</sub> streams on the dashboard items concering
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        <br/><br/> <strong>Note</strong>: it is important to balance the supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> in your system. The ETM assumes 
        that excess CO<sub>2</sub> is exported when supply of CO<sub>2</sub> is higher than demand. In reality, it is desirable to
        avoid an excess supply of CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, you should improve the settings of supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        in your scenario to avoid export of excess CO<sub>2</sub>.
