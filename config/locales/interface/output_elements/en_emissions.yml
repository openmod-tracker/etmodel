      short_description:
      description: "Emissions from transport are the result of freight transport, passenger transport,
      aviation or public transport. Apart from energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there are also non-energetic
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of transport. This includes the emissions of international transport 
      if you have allocted them to your scenario."

      description: |
        This chart describes how the CO<sub>2</sub> streams effect the net emissions.
        It contains 6 CO<sub>2</sub> categories, we will describe these here:
        <br/><br/>
        1. Captured 
        <br/><br/>
        This stream contains all the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in the system.
        It's influence on the net total is positive. 
        <br/><br/>
        2. Imported
        <br/><br/>
        This stream contains the imported CO<sub>2</sub> to the system. 
        It's influence on the net total is positive, since it adds to the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in the system.
        See the  <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-main-principles/#modelling-principles\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information.
        <br/><br/>
        3. Exported
        <br/><br/>
        This stream contains the exported CO<sub>2</sub> from the system.
        It's influence to the net total is negative, since the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the system.
        See the <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-main-principles/#modelling-principles\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information.
        <br/><br/>
        4. Stored
        <br/><br/>
        This stream contains all stored CO<sub>2</sub> in the system. 
        This is a negative stream, since the stored CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the system.
        <br/><br/>
        5. Indefinitely delayed
        <br/><br/>
        This stream contains all utilised CO<sub>2</sub> in chemical processes, which are indefinetily delayed from emission.
        Since these are not indefinitely delayed, the stream has a negative effect on the net total.
        <br/><br/>
        6. Captured biogenic share
        <br/><br/>
        This stream contains the biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. These are not counted while calculating the net CO<sub>2</sub>.
        These are therefore subtracted from the captured CO<sub>2</sub> stream.
        See the <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-main-principles/#modelling-principles\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information.
        <br/><br/>
        7. Total
        <br/><br/>
        This is the total net effect of CO<sub>2</sub> demand and supply on the dashboard item concering emissions.
