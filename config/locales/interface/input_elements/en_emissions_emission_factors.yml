      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of imported heat
      short_description:
      description: "How much CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are associated with imported
        heat? \r\n</br></br>\r\nThis strongly depends on the heat source. For reference:
        when heat originates from a gas CCGT plant, the emissions are around 36.0
        kg/GJ (<a href=\"https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/lijst-emissiefactoren\"

      description: |
        The ETM allocates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the area where the energy 
        is <i>used</i>, rather than the <i>location</i> of the emissions. This is why 
        emissions associated with hydrogen production are allocated to your scenario by default 
        for imported hydrogen. See our 
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emissions-import-export" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> for more information. </br></br>
        Below you can find reference values for the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of some common
        hydrogen production technologies (kg CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh H<sub>2</sub>): </br></br>
        <ul>
        <li>Steam Methane Reforming (SMR): 281 kg</li>
        <li>Autothermal Reforming (ATR): 281 kg</li>
        <li>Coal gasification: 540 kg</li>
        <li>Electrolysis (coal): 1320 kg</li>
        <li>Electrolysis (nuclear): 30 kg</li>
        <li>Electrolysis (solar/wind): 0 kg</li>
        </ul> </br>
        Note that these numbers do not
        take into account any CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that result from transporting
        hydrogen to your area. Supply chain emissions, such as the emissions resulting
        from building the hydrogen production plants or mining the required natural
        resources, are also not taken into account. </br></br>
