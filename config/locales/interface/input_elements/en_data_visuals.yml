      title: Capacity of wind turbines (per unit)
      description: |
        Set the capacity per unit for onshore wind turbines that you would like to be
        used by the Energy Mix infographic. This slider has no effect on your
        scenario but is only reflected in the energy mix visual.

      title: Large-scale inland wind
      description: |
        This slider influences the share of large-scale wind turbines (inland) in the total electricity production of wind inland.
        <br/><br/>
        A large-scale wind turbine is assumed to have a capacity of 3 MW.
