      title: Bio-oil
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This slider sets the share of bio-oil in gas-fired combined heat and power 
        (CHP) plants in industry.<br/><br/>Bio-oil is a liquid biofuel derived from 
        organic residual material, which can be atomized and burned together with 
        gas in CHP systems. In theory, full replacement of gas is possible, but in 
        practice the share is often limited. Use of bio-oil has declined due to 
        concerns about renewability.

        This slider sets the share of biocoal in coal-fired power plants.</br></br>
        Biocoal, produced by torrefaction of woody biomass, closely resembles coal 
        and can replace it in coal plants. This process, in which biomass is heated 
        to high temperatures without oxygen, produces a fuel with lower CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions than coal.

      description: |
        This slider sets the share of network gas in gas-fired combined heat and 
        power (CHP) plants in industry.<br/><br/>Network gas can be used as a fuel 
        in CHP systems for simultaneous heat and electricity generation. It consists 
        of natural gas or green gas.<br/><br/>Go to <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/gas-mix-in-gas-network">

      description: |
        This slider sets the share of oil in gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) 
        plants in industry.<br/><br/>The oil is atomized and injected together with gas. 
        In theory, gas can be fully replaced without loss of efficiency, but in practice 
        the blend is limited.

      title: Biogenic waste
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual energy potential of biogenic waste. <br/><br/>Biogenic waste, 
        such as food scraps, garden waste, and animal manure, can be converted into energy through 
        combustion in waste incineration plants or combined heat and power (CHP) systems. It can
        also be used for the production of transport fuels or as a raw material for the chemical 
        industry.

      title: Non-biogenic waste
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual energy potential of non-biogenic waste.<br/><br/>Non-biogenic 
        waste, such as plastics, textiles, and other household or industrial residuals 
        not of biological origin, can be converted into energy through combustion in waste 
        incineration plants or combined heat and power (CHP) systems. It can also be used for 
        the production of transport fuels or as a raw material for the chemical industry

      title: Wet biomass
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual energy potential of wet biomass.<br/><br/> Wet biomass 
        contains at least 40â€“50% moisture and includes residues from the food and beverage 
        industry, agricultural by-products, sewage sludge, aquatic biomass, and cultivated 
        grains.<br/><br/>View the chart <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="biomass_sankey"

      title: Dry biomass
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual energy potential of dry biomass.<br/><br/> Dry biomass 
        has a low moisture content, requires no pre-treatment, and provides high energy yield. 
        Examples include wood, recycled wood, agricultural residues (straw), and fast-growing 
        crops.<br/><br/>View the chart <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="biomass_sankey"

        This slider sets the annual energy potential of oil-rich biomass.<br/><br/> Oil-rich 
        biomass consists of oil-containing seeds. After pressing, crude biodiesel is obtained, 
        which is then converted into biodiesel through esterification with methanol. Examples 
        include rapeseed, sunflower seeds, palm oil, and used frying oils.<br/><br/> View the

        This slider sets the share of green gas from anaerobic digestion in green gas 
        production.<br/><br/>Anaerobic digestion is a biological process in which 
        microorganisms break down organic material in an oxygen-limited environment, 
        producing biogas. This biogas is upgraded to green gas and can be injected into 
        the gas network.

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the share of green gas from dry gasification in green gas 
        production.<br/><br/>In dry gasification, dry biomass is gasified with a 
        limited amount of oxygen, producing syngas. This gas, consisting of methane, 
        hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, can be further converted into 
        green gas for the gas network.

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the share of green gas from wet gasification (SCW) in green 
        gas production.<br/><br/>Wet gasification (Subcritical Water Gasification, SCW) 
        converts wet biomass into green gas by gasifying it under high pressure and 
        temperature. This process uses the water content in the biomass and produces 
        syngas, consisting of methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. 
        The gas can then be upgraded to green gas for the gas network.
