      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from Fischer-Tropsch.
        The process of Fischer-Tropsch converts syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) into liquid hydrocarbons.<br/><br/>
        The following feedstock (routes) can be used for syngas production for Fischer-Tropsch, and therefore
        represent feedstock going into this process:
        <ul>
        <li><b>hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub></b></li>
        <li><b>non-biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>dry biomass</b></li>
        </ul><br/>

        The output of Fischer-Tropsch consists of the following fuels and feedstock:
        <ul>
        <li><b>kerosene</b> (main product)</li>
        <li><b>diesel</b></li>
        <li><b>naphtha</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        Depending on the type of feedstock going into the process, the produced products from Fischer-Tropsch will
        differ in the extent to which they are synthetic, biogenic or non-biogenic.<br/><br/>
        Go to the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/fischer-tropsch">Fischer-Tropsch</a> section to set
        the shares the feedstock routes that produce syngas for Fischer-Tropsch.<br/><br/>

        This slider sets the annual useful production of methanol from methanol synthesis.
        In this process, syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) is converted to methanol.<br/><br/>
        The following feedstock (routes) can be used for syngas production for methanol synthesis, and therefore
        represent feedstock going into this process:
        <ul>

        </ul><br/>
        The only output product is <b>methanol</b>. Depending on the type of used feedstock, the produced methanol
        will differ in the extent to which it is synthetic, biogenic or non-biogenic.<br/><br/>
        In the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/methanol-synthesis">Methanol synthesis</a> section

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from fractionation of
        pyrolysis oil (non-biogenic). In this process, pyrolysis oil is upgraded through hydrotreatment.<br/><br/>
        The pyrolysis oil, required for fractionation, can be produced through fast pyrolysis of feedstock.
        Pyrolysis oil (non-biogenic) can only be produced with <b>non-biogenic waste</b>. Furthermore, there is
        input of <b>hydrogen</b> in the hydrotreatment process of fractionation of pyrolysis oil.<br/><br/>
        The following fuels and feedstock can be produced from pyrolysis oil fractionation:
        <ul>
        <li><b>diesel</b></li>
        <li><b>naphtha</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        The model assumes that required pyrolysis oil for the fractionation process or for baseload export is produced locally. This can be altered by
        setting import of pyrolysis oil, which will substitute the local production of pyrolysis oil.<br/><br/>
        Go to the section

        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from fractionation of biogenic
        pyrolysis oil (further referred to as pyrolysis bio-oil). In this process, pyrolysis bio-oil is upgraded through hydrotreatment.<br/><br/>
        The pyrolysis bio-oil, required for fractionation, can be produced through fast pyrolysis of feedstock.
        Pyrolysis bio-oil can be produced with the following feedstockL
        <ul>
        <li><b>biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>dry biomass</b></li>
        </ul><br/>

      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of HVO biokerosene (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) from hydrotreatment
        of oily biomass, such as vegetable oils and animal fats.<br/><br/>
        The process of producing HVO biokerosene and HVO biodiesel is very similar. The main difference is that an extra
        processing step of cracking is required for HVO biokerosene to obtain lighter fractions suitable for aviation fuel.<br/><br/>
        The feedstock input of hydrotreatment (for both HVO biokerosene and biodiesel) consists of <b>oily biomass</b> and
        <b>hydrogen</b> for the hydrotreatment process.<br/><br/>
        The output products of hydrotreatment to HVO biokerosene are:

      title: Fischer-Tropsch (with hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub>)
      description: |
        This slider sets the amount of installed dispatchable capacity (in electric input capacity) for synthetic kerosene and
        naphtha production from Fischer-Tropsch. Syngas for the Fischer-Tropsch process is produced with input of
        captured CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen and electricity.<br/><br/>
        The dispatchable production is electricity price-driven and is therefore considered as flexible electricity demand
        technology. The technology will produce when the electricity price is lower than the willingness to pay.
        <br/><br/>Go to the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-fuels">
