      description: |
        This slider sets the amount of installed dispatchable capacity for synthetic kerosene production (in electric input capacity)
        in your scenario. Synthetic kerosene is made from captured CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen and electricity. If renewable
        electricity, green hydrogen and green CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g. Direct Air Capture) are used in
        this process, it is possible to produce carbon neutral fuels for (e.g.) aviation.
        The dispatchable kerosene production is dependent on the electricity, it is therefore flexible demand for the electricity system.
        When the electricity price is lower than the willingness to pay, the dispatchable kerosene will run.
        When the electricity price is higher than the willingness to pay, it will not run.
        <br/><br/> The willingness to pay for dispatchable synthetic kerosene production can be set in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-kerosene-for-industry">
        Flexibility</a> section.
        <br/><br/>If you would like to know the total demand and supply of kerosene in your
        scenario, have a look at the
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="mekko_of_kerosene_demand_supply" data-chart-location="side">demand and supply of kerosene</a>
        chart. Any excess production is automatically exported, any deficit is imported.
        <br/><br/>
        Energy demand of international aviation is not taken into account in the ETM by default.
        This means that by default there is no kerosene demand for aviation. You can change this assumption
        in the <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_international_transport/international-transport">
        International transport</a> section.
        <br/><br/>
        Please note: this slider does not automatically reduce the production of fossil-based
        kerosene in the refineries sector. If you would like to replace fossil kerosene with
        synthetic kerosene in your scenario, you can reduce the market share of refineries in the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/refineries">Refineries</a> section.
