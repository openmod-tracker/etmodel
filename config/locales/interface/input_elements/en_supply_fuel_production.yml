      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from Fischer-Tropsch.<br/><br/>
        The process of Fischer-Tropsch converts syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) into liquid hydrocarbons.
        In the ETM, the following fuels and feedstock can be produced via Fischer-Tropsch:
        <ul>
        <li>Main product: kerosene</li>
        <li>By-products: naphtha, diesel</li>
        </ul><br/>
        Different types of feedstock can be used to produce syngas. Depending on
        the type of used feedstock, the produced liquid fuels from Fischer-Tropsch will differ in the extent to which they are synthetic,
        biogenic or non-biogenic.<br/><br/>
        In the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/fischer-tropsch-from-syngas">Fischer-Tropsch</a> section
        the shares of the different feedstock routes for syngas production for Fischer-Tropsch can be set.<br/><br/>

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of methanol from methanol synthesis.<br/><br/>
        Methanol can be produced by converting syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen). Different types of feedstock
        can be used to produce syngas. Depending on the type of used feedstock, the produced methanol will differ in the
        extent to which it is synthetic, biogenic or non-biogenic.<br/><br/>
        In the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/methanol-synthesis-from-syngas">Methanol synthesis</a> section
        the shares of the different feedstock routes for syngas production for methanol synthesis can be set.<br/><br/>

      title: Fractionation of pyrolysis oil
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from fractionation of
        pyrolysis oil.<br/><br/>
        In this process, pyrolysis oil is upgraded through hydrotreatment for which hydrogen is used. In the ETM,
        fractionation of pyrolysis oil yields the following fuels and feedstock:
        <ul>
        <li>diesel</li>
        <li>naphtha</li>
        </ul><br/>
        The pyrolysis oil required for this process can either be produced locally or imported. Go to the section
        <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/fractionation-of-pyrolysis-oil">Fractionation of pyrolysis oil</a> to
        set the local production of pyrolysis oil. In case the local production of pyrolysis oil is lower than
        the amount required for fractionation, the shortage is imported.<br/><br/>

      title: Fischer-Tropsch from syngas (from hydrogen, electricity en CO<sub>2</sub>)
      description: |
        This slider sets the amount of installed dispatchable capacity (in electric input capacity) for synthetic kerosene and
        naphtha production from Fischer-Tropsch. Syngas for the Fischer-Tropsch process is produced with input of
        captured CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen and electricity.<br/><br/>
        The dispatchable production is electricity price-driven and is therefore considered as flexible electricity demand
        technology. The technology will produce when the electricity price is lower than the willingness to pay.
        <br/><br/>Go to the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-fuels">
        Flexibility</a> section to set the willingness to pay of this technology.
        Consult the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand"
        target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for more information on flexible electricity demand technologies.<br/><br/>
